Explanation:
 * Import necessary libraries:
   * pandas for DataFrame manipulation
   * BDay from pandas.tseries.offsets for business day calculations
 * Define the calculate_net_business_days function:
   * Takes the sorted DataFrame as input.
   * Creates a new column 'Net_Business_Days' and initializes it with 0.
   * Iterates through each group of rows with the same 'K1' and 'K2' values.
     * If there's only one record in the group:
       * Calculates the business days between 'D3' and 'D1' using BDay() and assigns it to 'Net_Business_Days'.
     * If there are multiple records:
       * Iterates through each row except the last:
         * Calculates the business days between the current row's 'D2' and the next row's 'D2' using BDay().
       * For the last row:
         * Calculates the business days between 'D2' and 'D3' using BDay().
 * Example Usage:
   * Creates a sample DataFrame with 'K1', 'K2', 'D1', 'D2', and 'D3' columns.
   * Calls the calculate_net_business_days function to calculate 'Net_Business_Days'.
   * Prints the resulting DataFrame.
This code will correctly calculate the net business days based on the specified conditions for each group of records with the same 'K1' and 'K2' values.
Note:
 * This code assumes that 'D1', 'D2', and 'D3' are datetime columns in your DataFrame.
 * The DataFrame must be sorted by 'K1' and 'K2' before calling this function.
 * This code uses BDay() to calculate business days, which excludes weekends and holidays. You can adjust the definition of business days according to your specific requirements.
